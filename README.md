# Coursera Stanford Machine Learning

My solutions for Coursera Stanford Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng. The course teaches fundamentals of machine learning algorithms and how to structure machine learning projects. I strongly encourage you to solve problems by yourself first.

The assignments require the Octave or MATLAB scientific computing languages.
